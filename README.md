# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This Node.js command-line application allows you to generate a webpage that displays basic information about your software engineering team. It prompts the user to input details about the team members, including the manager, engineers, and interns, and then generates an HTML file based on the provided information.

## User story

As a team manager, I require a convenient way to compile and access essential information about my software engineering team. This tool enables me to swiftly generate a webpage displaying key details, such as names, roles, email addresses, and GitHub profiles, for each team member. This streamlines communication and collaboration within the team, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

I want to be able to:

- Input the details of the team manager, including their name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
- Add engineers to the team, including their name, ID, email, and GitHub username.
- Add interns to the team, including their name, ID, email, and school they are attending.
- Finish building the team when all necessary members have been added.
- Have an HTML file generated automatically containing all the team members' information, which I can refer to later for reference.
